# Every time you press `return` on your keyboard you're actually inserting an invisible character called a line ending.
# Historically, different operating systems have handled line endings differently.
# When you view changes in a file, Git handles line endings in its own way.
# Since you're collaborating on projects with multiple technologies and OS, Git might produce unexpected results if, for example, you're editing, on a Windows machine, some files that will be run under Linux on Docker.
# The git config core.autocrlf command is used to change how Git handles line endings. It works for diff on multi-os collaborating.
# On Windows, you simply pass true to the configuration: git config --global core.autocrlf true
# The following option do this for this project, in case people don't have core.autocrlf set.
* text=auto

# But we have some files that we want to explicitly force Linux line ending for working in Linux VM and containers :
*.yml text eol=lf
*.yaml text eol=lf
*.bash text eol=lf
*.sh text eol=lf
*.conf text eol=lf
